1. Download all the source files (.cc, .h) plus the Makefile to your own directory. (To download, click on the link with your right mouse button and select "Save Link As...".)
2. "make" (this will create the binary, sim_cache)
3. Try running "sim_cache" with any number of arguments. It will simply print "Hello World!" and then echo all the arguments back to you. For example, try this example from the Project 1 spec:
./sim_cache 32 8192 4 0 1 gcc_trace.txt
4. "make clean" (this will remove all .o files and the binary sim_cache)
5. "make" (build again)
6. "make clobber" (this will remove only .o files, leaving the binary sim_cache)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
You only need the Makefile from this directory. (The other bogus .cc/.h files are merely there as an example.) 
What you need to modify in the Makefile for your own needs:
1. In the Makefile, replace all the .cc filenames with your .cc filenames, on the line labeled SIM_SRC. You can use as few or as many .cc files as you want.
2. Likewise, update the names of .o files in the Makefile, on the line labeled SIM_OBJ. There must be a corresponding .o file for every .cc file.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
If you are using a different language/compiler, replace CC with your preferred compiler. You may also need to modify the default CFLAGS, depending on what other arguments your compiler requires. Also, if you use a different language, then you may need to change the .cc extensions to something else.
